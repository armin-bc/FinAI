The provision for credit losses (bps of average loans) within the private banking segment reveals an interesting dynamic between internal performance and the external macroeconomic environment. After a low of 21.99 bps in FY2022, provisions increased significantly in Q1 2023 to 40.42 bps, before settling down and fluctuating in a corridor from 22.28 to 29.84 bps until Q4 2023. FY2023 closed with 29.81bps. Throughout 2023, the IFO Business Climate Index showed a recovery from the sharp drop in early 2020, but then started a declining trend again.

The beginning of 2024 shows a decreasing Net Interest Income as well as Average Loans - which seem to be correlated. Interestingly, Q4 2024 again saw a significant jump to 43.36 bps, a 13.5 bps increase compared to Q4 2023 and 11.5 bps versus Q3 2024. Despite this increase, the full year 2024 average of 32.84 bps is only slightly elevated versus FY2023 (+3bps). While the IFO index initially showed a positive trend in the first half of 2024, it declined significantly in the second half - a development that could have influenced the rise in provisions.

The cost-income ratio decreased by almost 3 ppt from FY2023 to FY2024 which is a good sign - however, the increase of 3.7ppt from Q3 to Q4 2024 should be further investigated.

The significant jump in provisions in Q4 2024 despite a relatively stable full year average suggests a possible deterioration of credit quality towards the end of the year. Possible reasons could be a delayed effect from the continued weakness in the IFO Business Climate Index or a concentration of problematic loans in the fourth quarter. While the IFO index incorporates both current assessment and future expectations, the business expectations component has been more volatile. A continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio quality remains critical in light of the uncertain macroeconomic climate and the observed fluctuations in the IFO Business Climate Index.
